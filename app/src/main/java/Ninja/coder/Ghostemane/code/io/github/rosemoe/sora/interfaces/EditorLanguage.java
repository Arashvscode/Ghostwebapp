 * Language for editor
 * <p>
 * A Language helps editor to highlight text and provide auto-completion.
 * Implement this interface when you want to add new language support for editor.
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> A language must not be single instance.
 * One language instance should always serve for only one editor.
 * It means that you should not give a language object to other editor instances
 * after it has been applied to one editor.
 * This is to provide better connection between auto completion provider and code analyzer.
